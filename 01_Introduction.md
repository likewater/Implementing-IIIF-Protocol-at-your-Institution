# 1. Introduction

What does it mean to be a museum in the digital age? How can digital and emerging media help a world class cultural institution successfully meet its mission? Where does a museum begin on its path toward becoming truly optimized for the evolving digital landscape, and why is it important that museums do so?

The Andy Warhol Museum, like many of our sister institutions, is confronting questions like these with the museum's first formal digital strategy. This document is intended to be a roadmap as the museum works to infuse digital activities into its fabric. From in-gallery interactive projects to the digital literacy of Warhol staff (and all points in between), a structured strategy helps the museum stay focused on priorities and goals, and it serves as a repository for progress along our journey.

### A Real-Time Document

The Warhol's digital strategy for 2015-2020 is a real-time document. This means it is living and evolving as we deploy tactics to meet the strategies contained herein. Each strategic thrust includes a *Strategy in Action* section, where we will make updates, additions and notes about ongoing activities.

By structuring our digital strategy as a living document, we have the freedom to respond quickly to external conditions, such as rapid shifts in technology and real-time digital metrics reporting. A transparent document such as this also keeps the museum publicly accountable for progress and momentum.

### An Open-Source Repository

GitHub is traditionally used to host versioned source code that developers can share and collaboratively make better. While it is not code, it is in this spirit that The Andy Warhol Museum makes its digital strategy open. Andy Warhol pioneered the concept of democratization in the art world. His ethos informs our institutional push to develop digital projects in the open and operate transparently.

## 1.1 Vision Statement

Simply stated, the museum’s vision for the future is: *The Andy Warhol Museum will be a global destination for scholarship and learning about Warhol’s life, art, and relevance to contemporary culture. With expanded access to the collection and engaging experiences, the museum will be a sustainable model for inclusivity and a platform for creative expression.* 

Among our stated values is this: *Our collection is the heart of our institution and we will succeed through sharing, preserving, and interpreting the collection in the most accessible way possible.* 

Using databases that integrate our collection’s data (TMS) and images (NetX), that are properly managed and maintained, and that provide access to our entire collection is key to realizing our vision to become a global destination for scholarship and learning about Warhol’s life, art, and relevance to contemporary culture. Our DAMS (NetX) is really the key to all of this, and without a healthy, properly implemented Digital Asset Management System we can’t succeed in sharing, preserving, and interpreting the collection in the most accessible way possible. 

## 1.2 Strategic Thrusts

The Warhol has identified several areas of intense focus for digital and emerging media in the coming years. These areas of focus align with the museum's broader strategic goals and are designed to compliment them.

Strategic thrusts for 2015-2017 included:

* Experiences and Engagement
* Narratives and Access
* Organizational Adaptation
* Financial Solvency

Collection Database goals for 2019-2020 include:

* Place all the collection data on GitHub as a shareable CSV file
* Create a NetX Portal that houses all the TC finding aids and links them to their related objects
* Film and Video (and audio?) preservation
* Incorporation of our institutional history documents into the realm of the objects they enhance and describe
* Upgrading NetX to version 8.12 then version 9
* Upgrading TMS to version 2018
* Securing enough server space in anticipation of future growth and use over the next five years

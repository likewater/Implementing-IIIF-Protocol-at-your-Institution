## Digital Collections Strategy: 2015 - 2020

This is a versioned digital strategy repository for [The Andy Warhol Museum](http://www.warhol.org) in Pittsburgh, PA, USA. The strategy is designed to grow with the museum through technology's rapid evolution and be a living resource the museum can use to navigate the fast-moving and often uncharted waters of the emerging digital landscape. Initially, this strategy was conceived and written in 2015, and maintained through 2017. As the new Collections Database Admin (2019), I felt it was necessary to fork the original and use it as an initial base to set future goals and policies. This document will reflect the tasks and goals needed to create a healthy digital collection that is shareable, and can be used by other internal AWM groups to make connections and engage with the public. It is always a work in progress.

We are using GitHub to draft and publish this strategy, which makes a catalog of previous versions accessible. In addition, the source files can be easily shared and repurposed within the cultural sector. We intend to revisit and update this strategy regularly as tactics and technologies evolve.

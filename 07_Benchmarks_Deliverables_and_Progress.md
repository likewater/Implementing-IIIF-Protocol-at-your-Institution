# 7. Benchmarks, Deliverables and Progress

A digital strategy is only beneficial to an organization if the results are measured and evaluated on an ongoing basis. Benchmarking and evaluating our efforts are the keystones toward progress as we work within the framework of this strategy. The museum's Digital Asset Working Group (DAWG) meets regularly to hone in on standards, discuss best practices, and consult with internal partners on how to move forward in the best way possible so we, as a collective group, can realize our institutional vision and goals.

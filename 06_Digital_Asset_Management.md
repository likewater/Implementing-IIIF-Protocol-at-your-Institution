# 6. Digital Asset Management


### 6.1 The Power of a DAMS (NetX and its API)

Included in the NetX Developer Tool Kit module is a full Web Services API, so you can essentially remote-control the application from any external system.The API itself is built on Apache’s Axis Web Service framework, meaning that it is entirely standards-compliant and interoperates with Java and .NET. The Web Services API provides SOAP-RPC over HTTP access to NetX, and includes documentation, sample code, and Java-wrapper code.

This provides for remote usage of NetX from any system that can communicate with standard Web Service protocols, such as SOAP and WSDL — allowing any such system to integrate directly with the repository. Most operations you can manually access through the Web User-Interface can be automated through the Web Services.

The advantages a Web Services API brings to the NetX DAM are numerous. For example, external applications such as e-commerce sites, catalog workflow software, remote kiosks, or content management systems can “talk to the DAM” resulting in a seamless “push” of content such as images and data from the DAM to the external application upon request.

Or in the cases where the DAM needs to be continually populated with new information from external sources, the Web Services API can set up to automatically “pull” files and data into the DAM from external sources such as a legacy collections management system in a museum.

The Web Services API provides a standard WSDL interface for auto-discover, as well as a Java wrapper that allows the developer to avoid having to learn anything about Web Services protocols.The Java wrapper provides access to Web Services with the IPClient class; each method handles all the SOAP messaging and authentication for you.

### 6.2 User Access and the IIIF Viewer

Access to image-based resources is fundamental to research, scholarship and the transmission of cultural knowledge. Digital images are a container for much of the information content in the Web-based delivery of images, books, newspapers, manuscripts, maps, scrolls, single sheet collections, and archival materials. Yet much of the Internet’s image-based resources are locked up in silos, with access restricted to bespoke, locally built applications.

A growing community of the world’s leading research libraries and image repositories have embarked on an effort to collaboratively produce an interoperable technology and community framework for image delivery.

IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework) has the following goals:

To give scholars an unprecedented level of uniform and rich access to image-based resources hosted around the world.
To define a set of common application programming interfaces that support interoperability between image repositories.
To develop, cultivate and document shared technologies, such as image servers and web clients, that provide a world-class user experience in viewing, comparing, manipulating and annotating images.

### 6.3 Making the Case: Why We Need a Curator of Digital Objects

Traditionally, curators are responsible for acquiring material for a collection, preserving these materials for future generations, helping users locate items from the collection and providing contextual information so they can better understand them, and designing exhibits for the benefit and enjoyment of the public. A digital curator will do all of these things, provide oversight and direction, as well as the following:

Make as much of our collection available online as copyright law, professional ethics, and our budget permits.
 
Provide both contextual information and software tools to make our digital collections as useful as possible.
 
Improve methods for preserving and providing access to the "born digital"  materials that are now part of the creative history of most contemporary works of art.

### 6.4 Strategy In Action

The following are projects initiated or deployed in 2020 that exemplify the Organizational Transformation strategy outlined above:

* Attending the IIIF 2020 Conference in Boston, MA.
* Ensuring that EVERY digital asset has the proper copyright and use information attached to it.

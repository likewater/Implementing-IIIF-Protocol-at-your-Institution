# 5. Time Based Media (Video and Audio)

### 5.1 Preservation and Storage

"Film is a fragile medium. If improperly stored, films shrink, crack, and congeal into an inseparable mass. The color and imagery may fade, the magnetic soundtrack may separate from the base, and the film itself may flake or break apart. Eventually, the film will disintegrate and turn to dust. Only cool, stable storage conditions discourage fading and deterioration."

Preserving the films and audio tapes, making them accessible to researchers, creating the right storage environment. Understanding that NetX is not the proper storage place for our digitized films, but can be used to provide short clips.

Creating public access to time based media. Copyright concerns. Pirating concerns.

The following are projects initiated or deployed in 2019 that exemplify the Organizational Transformation strategy outlined above:
